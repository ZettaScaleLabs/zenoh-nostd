//! # Byte Buffer Abstractions
//!
//! This module provides zero-copy, `no_std` compatible traits for reading and writing
//! byte buffers. These traits are the foundation of the Zenoh protocol codec system.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The module defines two primary trait families:
//!
//! - **Writing**: [`ZWriteable`] and optionally [`ZStoreable`] for capturing written data
//! - **Reading**: [`ZReadable`] for consuming byte data
//!
//! ## Writing Data
//!
//! The [`ZWriteable`] trait provides methods for writing bytes into a buffer:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut buffer = [0u8; 128];
//! let mut writer = &mut buffer[..];
//!
//! writer.write_u8(42)?;
//! writer.write_exact(&[1, 2, 3, 4])?;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Reading Data
//!
//! The [`ZReadable`] trait provides methods for reading bytes from a buffer:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let data = &[42u8, 1, 2, 3, 4][..];
//! let mut reader = data;
//!
//! let value = reader.read_u8()?;
//! let slice = reader.read_slice(4)?;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementations
//!
//! Both traits are implemented for mutable byte slices (`&mut [u8]`) and
//! immutable byte slices (`&[u8]`), providing efficient cursor-based operations.

/// Trait for writing bytes into a buffer in a streaming fashion.
///
/// This trait provides methods for writing data sequentially into a byte buffer.
/// The buffer automatically advances as data is written, maintaining a cursor position.
///
/// # Implementation Note
///
/// The standard implementation for `&mut [u8]` uses pointer arithmetic to advance
/// the slice as data is written, providing zero-overhead abstraction.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// let mut buffer = [0u8; 16];
/// let mut writer = &mut buffer[..];
///
/// writer.write_u8(0x42)?;
/// writer.write_exact(&[1, 2, 3])?;
///
/// assert_eq!(writer.remaining(), 12);
/// ```
pub trait ZWriteable {
    /// Returns the number of bytes remaining in the buffer.
    ///
    /// This indicates how much more data can be written before the buffer is full.
    fn remaining(&self) -> usize;

    /// Writes bytes from the source slice into the buffer.
    ///
    /// This method writes as many bytes as possible (up to `src.len()` or the
    /// remaining buffer space, whichever is smaller) and returns the number
    /// of bytes actually written.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `src`: The source data to write
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// The number of bytes successfully written.

    ///

    /// or returns an error.

    /// # Parameters
    ///
